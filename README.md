# 🧠 Edge.ai | The Infinite Strategy Co-Pilot

> **Hackathon Track:** AGI / Fintech / UX  
> **Built By:** Solo Dev (3-Hour Sprint)

### **The Pitch**
Trading isn't about a lack of information; it's about **cognitive overload**. Every trader has an "edge"—whether it's Wyckoff, Elliott Wave, or obscure Goldbach mathematics—but humans get tired, emotional, and miss setups.

**Edge.ai is a Multimodal AI Co-Pilot that speaks your specific technical language.**

It ingests entire trading manuals (PDFs), "learns" the strategy instantly via In-Context Learning, and analyzes market data *strictly* through that lens. It doesn't give generic advice; it clones your discipline.

### **✨ Key Features (The "Wow" Moments)**

#### 1. 📚 The "Universal Translator" Engine
Upload a 200-page PDF on *any* trading strategy. The AI reconfigures its entire analysis engine in seconds to identifying patterns, terminology, and risk rules specific to that document.

#### 2. 🔍 Infinite Zoom (The "Goldbach" Demo)
Experience the "Fractal Reality" of markets. As you zoom in from a Yearly view to a 5-minute view, our engine dynamically renders nested support/resistance grids based on the "Power of 3" math defined in our demo strategy.

#### 3. 🎲 The "Game Loop" Backtester
Prove the edge without risking capital:
1.  **Spin the Wheel:** Load a random slice of historical market data.
2.  **Analyze:** Watch the AI construct a narrative and predict the next move based on your uploaded PDF.
3.  **Reveal:** Instantly see the future price action to validate the AI's logic.
